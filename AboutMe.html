      Hello there! My name is Diana Pagaduan, and I'm an IT student with a deep passion for all things related to graphics design and art.  
      <br>I believe that creativity knows no bounds, and I constantly strive to push the limits of my imagination.
      
      <br> <br/>
      As someone who always seeking new avenues of self-expression, I find immense joy in exploring various art forms and experimenting 
      <br>with different techniques. Whether it's digital design, photo editing, or even photography, I love immersing myself in the world of visuals
      <br>and creating works that evoke emotions and tell stories.

      <br> <br/>
      My main goal is to finish school and get a degree in Information Technology. I'm motivated to provide myself with the skills and abilities
      <br>required to succeed in the creative industry because education is essential to shaping one's future. Beyond that, 
      <br>I would like to have an impact on the field of design by producing pieces that touch and inspire individuals from every walk of life.
   
      <br> <br/>
      Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I invite you to explore my gallery and witness the passion and creativity 
      <br>that I pour into my work. Let's connect and explore this artistic journey together!
